The mode simulations are run as followed:
1) open the MODE solver
2) drag the 'funciton_make_wg.lfd' file into the MODE solver
3) drag any of the 'block_with_ring.....sweep.lsf' files into the MODE solver
4) run the simulation

your results will be saved into the results folder. Please create new files for new simulations.
